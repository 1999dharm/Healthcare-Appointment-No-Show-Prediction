# Healthcare-Appointment-No-Show-Prediction


Project Objective:
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on medical appointment data to understand factors that influence whether patients show up for their appointments or not.
The goal is to uncover insights that can help medical service providers reduce no-show rates by identifying key variables (like age, gender, SMS reminders, medical conditions, etc.) that impact patient attendance
